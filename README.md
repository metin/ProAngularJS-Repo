# ProAngularJS (2017)
> Examples and Concepts from ProAngularJS book, by Adam Freeman (Apress, 2014)

## A note about the branches
This repository contains my take on the examples and exercises found in the book. The `master` branch contains the original implementation I did on 2014, and the `angular2016` branch intention was to develop the same examples done on 2016, but i never completed it.

The `angular2017` branch is another take at the same idea, but on 2017!.

Several things have changed since then, the library versions, the task runner version plugins and also the approach to some things such as the dependency management.

## A note about the directory structure of the examples
The examples are grouped into folders:
+ **part00-project-templates** &mdash; Project templates for the examples
+ **part01-getting-ready** &mdash; Examples covering several topics at once including AngularJS, Bootstrap 4, etc.
