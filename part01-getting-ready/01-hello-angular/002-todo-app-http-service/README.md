> AngularJS ToDo app with inline model

## Details
An implementation of ToDo list app using AngularJS in which the model is hardcoded in the `app.js` file.

The application features a simple MVC approach in which, the Angular app and the controller are defined in the `app.js` file.

Several major Angular capabilities are demonstrated:
+ controllers
+ custom filters
+ one-way and two-way binding between the model and the view
+ built-in directives: `ng-hide`, `ng-class`, `ng-repeat`...
+ form validation: an empty task cannot be added
