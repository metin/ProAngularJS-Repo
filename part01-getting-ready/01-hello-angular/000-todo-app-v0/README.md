> Static mock-up of the ToDo app

## Details
Create a static mock-up of the ToDo app.

The screen consists of a panel header with some text `Sergio's To Do list`. Beneath it an input textfield and an `Add` button. Right below it a striped table with two columns `Description` and `Done`.

Although the application does not yet make use of AngularJS, must contain the appropriate `<script>` tag and the definition of the angular module `todoApp`.
