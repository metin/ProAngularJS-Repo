# ProAngularJS: SportsStore Final application

This directory contains the client side applications of SportsStore:
    . store: the Customer Store where anyone can browse products and make purchases.
    . admin: The Administration site in which registered users can browse products and orders and administrators can maintain products and browse existing orders.

Both applications are deployed in a single server installed on port 5000.

To start the server type `grunt serve`. This will open apps/index.html with some relevant information.
